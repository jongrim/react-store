# Local Install
Clone locally and change into the project directory. Within, there are two separate applications, the client, and the server. Each subdirectory has it's own package.json file. Change into each subdirectory and run `npm install` to install the packages.

Once the packages are installed, you can start either with `npm run start`. You need to start both to have the full application running.

You may also run tests for the server using `npm run tests`.
